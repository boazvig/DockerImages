# DockerImages

important installation remarks:

1. Open3D should be v0.9.0 for agile - to be tested
2. git clone --recursive -b 'v0.9.0' (do not foget recursive :))
3. agile contains some more compilation error :
3. 1 includes path to open3d instead of Open3D - fixed locally
3. 2 compilation error for rviz visualization error - could be bacause of wrong open3d version - should be checked
